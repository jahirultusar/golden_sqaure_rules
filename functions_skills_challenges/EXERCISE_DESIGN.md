# Exercise
In this project you will build a personal diary system. You'll start by writing a couple of functions that will be useful later on.

Test-drive a function with the following design:

## Design

A function called make_snippet that takes a string as an argument and returns the first five words and then a '...' if there are more than that.

You may immediately think "I know how to code that!". Resist that temptation and stick to the test-driving process.

1. Write a small example as a test.
2. Run the test (RED).
3. Write enough code to make that test pass.
4. Run the test (GREEN).
5. Refactor if necessary.
6. Return to step 1 and keep going until your program is complete.
